# LED-Circuit-Top
16 LED's sewn onto a cropped tank top with a mesh fabric overlay
This project is combines a love for fashion with a love for electronic music into a synchronized aesthetic. 16 LEDS are hand sewn into a circuit on the front of a silky black tank top. A mesh over layer is added to complete the throwback fishnet raver reference.
